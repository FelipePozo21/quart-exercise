        You can pay for the production of your product in advance and begin the
        production process immediately. We also have a pre-order function, which
        allows you to take orders during production until completion, and the
        crowdfunding method, which allows you to collect orders in advance and
        then begin the manufacturing process. If you dont want to pay for the
        production costs upfront, or if you want to collect orders from your
        fans before deciding on the final number of pieces to be produced, try
        crowdfunding. No risk, no waste.
