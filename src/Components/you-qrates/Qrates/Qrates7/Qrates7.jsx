        By storing your inventory in the Qrates warehouse, you can continue to
        sell your work on Qrates. You can manufacture the exact number of copies
        as your project collected at the end of the crowdfunding campaign, or
        you can make more copies and continue to sell them on Qrates.

        Repressing records is always easy. Master stampers can be stored at the
        factory for 18 months at no charge, so there is no need to make new
        stampers within that time frame. Use the repress requests from fans as a
        signal on when to repress more records.
